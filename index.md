My name is Nguyen Lam Duy and this is my blog where I've curated a collection of my learning journey, interests, and the personal projects that I'm most proud of.

You can visit my profile via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nlduy/).

I have summarized everything in a way I understand it from teachers' lectures, textbooks, internet, AI and even notes from my classmate. However, it will always have limitations and flaws because of my incompetence. Therefore, if you see something incorrect or would like to contribute further, I would greatly appreciate it.
